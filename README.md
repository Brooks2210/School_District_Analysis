## Overview of Analysis
PyCity Schools needed an analysis of how each high school was doing on state mandated testing and wanted to compare testing data with the school’s size, type, budget, and spending per student. The school board of PyCity Schools believes that this analysis will help them better manage their resources and detect any academic problems a school might be having. 

## Results
In reviewing the original analysis several anomalies are present. All the District schools have a much lower overall passing percentage than what would be expected given their individual Math and Reading passing percentages. In addition, the District schools spend more per student, but according to the analysis are getting less value for their spending compared to the Charter schools. The Charter school data is more consistent and inline with the individual passing rates of each subject except for Thomas High School. Given the anomalies in the District school data, the school board as asked that Thomas High School be further analyzed and the removal of the ninth grade scores be conducted. The original analysis is presented below as well as the top five schools in the original analyses.

## Updated Results
In the updated analysis Thomas High School’s ninth grade scores were removed and the district wide analysis was conducted again. As indicated in the table below, the overall passing percentage at Thomas High School was more consistent with the individual passing percentages of each individual subject. The removal of the ninth grade scores at Thomas High School also moved them into the top five performing schools within the district.

## Summary
The district wide analyses provided several insights into the academics and financial health of the district. A closer analysis needs to be conducted on all District schools as their test scores were not consistent and there is either a reporting issue or larger misconduct. The Charter Schools are providing the best performance at a cheaper cost and should be either modeled district wide or looked at more closely for best practices. Overall, the analysis provides many insights, but perhaps shows many more questions that need to be asked and answered.
